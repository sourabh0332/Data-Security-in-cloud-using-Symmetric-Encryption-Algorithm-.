# Data-Security-in-cloud-using-Symmetric-Encryption-Algorithm-.
The Proposed technique to improve the classical encryption techniques by integrating substitution cipher and transposition cipher. 
This substitution and transposition techniques have used alphabet for cipher text. 
In over proposed algorithm, first stage the plain text is converted into corresponding ASCII code (Hexadecimal) value of each alphabet. In classical encryption technique, the key value ranges between 1 to 26 or key may be string (combination alphabets).
But our proposed algorithm, key value range between 1 to 256.
This algorithm is used in order to encrypt the data of the user in the clouds by manipulating the matrix
